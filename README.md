# DSA Visualizer

A web-based tool for visualizing common Data Structures and Algorithms to aid in understanding their functionality and performance.

## Introduction

DSA Visualizer provides an interactive and visual representation of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) to help users comprehend their operations step by step.

## Features

- Visualize common Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- Illustrate Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Traversal, etc.) in real-time.
- Adjustable speed controls for visualization.
- User-friendly interface with clear visualization.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- Visualization Library: D3.js or other relevant libraries
- ...
